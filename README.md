"Group" project for St Cloud's CSCI 642 NLP class.  

It's a "group project" in the sense that i did the entire damn thing and a group gets credit for it.  

Nothing Special.  Uses this data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bornaetminan/yelp-reviews-polarity-cleaned-dataset

The MLP is pretty basic because I didn't want to waste all day training it and it still hit great metrics.

I might toss it in DistilBERT or do some tuning later, but i'm sick of it.
